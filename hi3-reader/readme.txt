NOTE: For detailed instructions on how to prepare your HyperImage project for use with this Reader and customize layout and on-screen languages please refer to the  documentation located in "reader/docs".
NOTE: Versions 3.0.x are the last versions of the static reader to support the deprecated PeTAL 1.2 format.


Features include:
• the interactive display of image-based media elements (views, layers, groups and light tables),
• the meaningful assignment of texts (metadata, annotations and transcriptions),
• and the provision of interactive functions.

Its main functions consist in retracing project-specific structures set up by the HyperImage author. Cross-reference can be followed up by clicking on sensitive areas in images or on text links.

Particular features of the HyperImage Reader include various navigation aids (back references, logs, bookmarks, etc.), the search function and an editor for light tables. Light tables are collections of images, thumbnails, enlarged details and written annotations, applied for example when providing comments in image comparisons. Such light tables can be exported and then integrated in HyperImage projects with the help of the HyperImage Editor.

This is a complete re-implementation using HTML5 and JavaScript technologies allowing for a modern viewing experience without needing any plug-ins (i.e. Adobe Flash) and enabling the application to directly work on mobile devices.

The data is based on XML meta-language. The HyperImage Editor exports the structures, metadata and texts in the XML format PeTAL (Picture Text Annotation Language). The PeTAL file is prepared by a converter for use in the HyperImage Reader, is fully indexed and secured in ‘postPeTAL’ format. This format works without a database. To publish a project it is sufficient to load the converted HyperImage project as a data package on to a web server or burn it on to a CD-ROM.
