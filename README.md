## HyperImage Virtual Research Environment (About)

The HyperImage platform supports the linking of (audio)-visual objects, texts and mixed-media documents. HyperImage allows any number of details, or subregions, within an image to be highlighted and described, and link annotations within a corpus to each other, making them accessible in indices. Interim results as well as final versions can be compiled at any time as an online/offline hypermedia publication. This makes HyperImage a suitable research environment for digital humanities and eScience projects, providing a common research and publication environment for groups as well as individuals.

The HyperImage Virtual Research Environment is released under an Open Source License and is maintained and constantly developed further by the Berlin-based company [bitGilde IT Solutions UG](http://bitgilde.de/).
